# LSTM-based-Predicitve-Mantainance-Model
This project applies an AI-based predictive maintenance system based on a combination of predictive time series forecasts using LSTM and classification using Random Forest. It analyzes sensor data from industrial machines to analyze data to prevent, detect, and diagnose faults more quickly and help reduce downtime and maintenance costs.
