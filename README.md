# LSTM-based-Predicitve-Mantainance-Model

This project is developed and executed in Google Colab and demonstrates predictive maintenance using LSTM forecasting and Random Forest classification. It includes Python code, required datasets, and all relevant resources to reproduce the results. The code is written in a clean, modular format, with comments explaining each step for clarity.

The repository contains:

Source Code

Generated Outputs: The first graph shows the LSTM model's predicted vs. actual time-series values, the second graph displays feature importance from the Random Forest classifier, and the third graph illustrates the classification report metrics for predictive maintenance performance.
